The prediction of environmental disasters, both technogenic and natural, is currently based on advances in mathematical modeling. The high cost and costly maintenance of computing clusters actualizes the research in the field of heterogeneous computing. One of the directions of them is to maximize the use of all available hardware resources, including the central processor and the video adapters (GPU). The purpose of the research is to develop an algorithm and a software module that implements it for solving a system of linear algebraic equations (SLAE) by the modified alternating-triangular iterative method (MATM) (self-adjoint and non-self-adjoint cases) for the hydrodynamics problem of shallow water using NVIDIA CUDA technology. The conducted experiment with the flow distribution along the Ox and Oz axes of the computational grid at a fixed value of the grid nodes along the Oy axis allowed reducing the implementation time of one step of the MATM on the GPU. A regression equation was obtained at the experimental data processing in the Statistica program, on the basis of which it was found that the implementation time of one step of the MATM on the GPU is affected only by the number of threads along the axis Oz. The optimal two-dimensional configuration of threads in a computing unit executed on a single thread multiprocessor is determined, in which the calculation time on the GPU for one step of the MATM is minimal.
