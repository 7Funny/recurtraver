The report discusses the problem of exact calculation and evaluation of network reliability. We consider two common reliability measures for networks with unreliable edges: all-terminal network reliability and diameter constrained network reliability. For each of them the problem of its calculation is NP-hard. Parallel algorithms for calculating and evaluating these characteristics with use of GPUs are proposed. The results of numerical experiments are presented.
