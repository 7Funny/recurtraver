This article proposes precompilers to accelerate the solvers of the application software package. The substantiations of this approach are given. The precompiler can be most valuable for programs that are intended to be ported to different computing architectures. There are given some examples of speeding up programs that implement iterative numerical methods using a precompiler in this paper. In particular, skew tiling and parallelization of loops with a linear recurrent dependence are implemented in the presented precompilers. The results of numerical experiments demonstrate the acceleration of programs by the precompiler by tens of percents and sometimes tens of times.
