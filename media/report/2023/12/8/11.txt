Parallel application can be studied with the means of the supercomputer performance monitoring system. The monitoring system agent activates during the parallel program run to collect data from system sensors. It occupies program’s resources and causes perturbation in the monitored program workflow. The influence of the performance monitoring system on parallel applications is poorly studied. We propose to measure the monitoring system noise using a benchmark based on MPI collective operations All-to-All and Barrier—the noise detector. We present measurements of the detector execution time under influence of a real monitoring system and without it. The results demonstrate that monitoring system agent has negligible influence on the detector when the agent and the detector have different CPU core affinity. On the other hand, monitoring system agent impact is statistically significant on the execution of All-to-All and Barrier when bound to the same logical core as the collective operations.
