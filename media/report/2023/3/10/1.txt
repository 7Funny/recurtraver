Automatic construction of high performance distributed numerical simulation programs is used to reduce complexity of distributed parallel programs development and to improve code efficiency as compared to an average manual development. Development of such means, however, is challenging in general case, thatâ€™s why a variety of different languages, systems and tools for parallel programs construction exist and evolve. Program tracing (i.e. journaling execution acts of the program) is a valuable source of information, which can be used to optimize efficiency of constructed programs for particular execution conditions and input data peculiarities. One of the optimization techniques is trace playback, which consists in step-by-step reproduction of the trace. This allows reducing run-time overhead, which is relevant for runtime system-based tools. The experimental results demonstrate suitability of the technique for a range of applications.
