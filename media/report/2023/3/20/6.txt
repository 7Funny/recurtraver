Sparse system solution methods (S3M) is a collection of interoperable linear solvers and preconditioners organized into a C++ header-only library. The current set of methods in the collection span both rather traditional Krylov space acceleration methods and smoothers as well as advanced incomplete factorization methods and rescaling and reordering methods. The methods can be integrated into algebraic multigrid and multi-stage fashion to construct solution strategies for complex linear systems that originate from coupled multi-physics problems. Several examples are considered in this work, that includes Constrained Pressure Residual (CPR) multi-stage strategy for oil & gas problem and Schur complement method for the system obtained with mimetic finite difference discretization for anisotropic diffusion problem.
