Usually, an information graph with associative operations has a sequential (“head/tail”) or parallel (“half-splitting”) topology with invariable quantity of operational vertices. If computational resource is insufficient for the implementation of all vertices, the reduction transformations of graphs with basic structures do not allow for the creation of an efficient resource-independent program for reconfigurable computer systems. In this paper, we propose to transform the topology of a graph with associative operations into a combined variant with sequential and parallel fragments of calculations. The resultant combined topology depends on computational resource of a reconfigurable computer system, and such transformation provides the improvement of specific performance for the reduced computing structure. We develop an algorithm for the conversion of the initial sequential graph to various combined topologies or to the limiting case of the “half-splitting” topology with regard to available hardware resource. This technique is described using the Set@l programming language.
